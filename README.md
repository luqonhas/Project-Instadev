## Development Process 📈
This project was divided into a few sprints to be able to organize it properly throughout the development process.

There will be a total of 2 development sprints:


* _**SPRINT 1 - <ins>FRONT-END**_</ins> 📰<br>
Sprint responsible for the development of the **WEB** project interface, which will be developed through **HTML** and **CSS**, with small participation of **JavaScript**.


* _**SPRINT 2 - <ins>BACK-END**_</ins> 🔙<br>
Sprint responsible for the development of the entire structure behind the application, where **C#** was used as the *main language* for this project which also had other technologies and resources for its development, such as: **.NET Core** (or .NET, currently), **CSV files** (to store the data of registered users), **MVC** (software design, in which it was used to divide the logic of the program into 3 parts, Model-View-Controller) and among others *Frameworks* and *Models*.
